# Homelab Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the infrastructure and automation code for my home lab environment. The goal is to create a fully automated, scalable, and manageable system for hosting Kubernetes clusters, applications, and related services. The project uses modern Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and configuration management tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes to streamline the provisioning, configuration, and deployment processes.

## Goals

- Provision and configure staging and production Kubernetes clusters on Proxmox VMs.
- Automate all aspects of cluster management, including infrastructure provisioning, Kubernetes setup, and application deployments.
- Implement GitOps principles for declarative and version-controlled infrastructure and applications.
- Enable CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth deployments and updates for both infrastructure and applications.
- Securely manage sensitive data like secrets and credentials.

## Key Features

- Ansible:
    - Install and configure Kubernetes components, container runtimes, and dependencies.
    - Manage VM-level configuration (e.g., OS setup, security hardening).

- Kubernetes:
    - Deploy staging and production clusters.
    - Utilize manifests and Helm charts for workload deployments.

- GitOps:
    - Leverage ArgoCD or Flux for cluster state synchronization from this repository.

- CI/CD Pipelines:
    - Automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
    - Deploy applications seamlessly with minimal downtime.
